description: How the three selectable answer formats per diagnostic test relate to grading and progress.
---

Each diagnostic reasoning test is one logical `(instrument, phase)` group offered in THREE selectable answer formats (mcq | hybrid | written), seeded as separate assessment rows (2 instruments × 2 phases × 3 formats = 12 rows).

**Rule:** the formats are ALTERNATIVES, not extra required work. A student picks ONE format per group and takes it.

**Why:** treating each of the 12 rows as independently-required work inflates the diagnostics denominator — completing one format per group (the intended path) would otherwise read as 4/12 instead of full credit.

**How to apply:**
- Any gradebook / progress / callout aggregation over diagnostics MUST group by `(instrument, phase)` and treat any-format-pass as a group pass (expected 4 groups), never count per assessment row.
- The dashboard callout and gradebook reasoning rows are collapsed to one row per group and link to the chooser (`/reasoning`) so the student picks a format.
- No cheating/AI-authorship detection runs on diagnostics (intentional) — the keystroke trace from the shared AnswerInput is captured but ignored on this path.
- Per-format question content is NOT forced identical; the app generates fresh same-kind variant items per attempt, and the student only sees the one format they chose, so divergence across formats is never observed.

**Brevity mandate (audience = busy college students/professors):** keep written effort minimal or they abandon the test and score artificially low.
- Hybrid's written justification is OPTIONAL (graded on the chosen option); only the pure Written format requires text. Never block submit on a missing hybrid note.
- Prompts/instructions must invite a one-sentence answer; never over-structure ("give three examples, one about X, one about Y…").
- Written/hybrid grading judges the CORE idea only — short, fragmentary, ALL-CAPS answers must pass; never penalize length/form (gradeAnswer already enforces this).
- Diagnostic textareas use AnswerInput `compact` + `allowPaste` (no detection here, so pasting is fine).
- Seed instructions are part of the reseed signature, so wording changes self-heal on restart.

**Selectable length per attempt (on top of format):** before starting (and again on retake) the student picks Short / Medium / Long, mapping to question counts — critical {5,10,15}, ethical {3,6,10}. Critical medium == prior behavior; ethical was widened to 3/6/10 (user wanted "a few"→"a lot", 1/2/3 felt too small).
- `length` is an OPTIONAL field on the start request (default medium); count resolves server-side via `itemCountFor(instrument, length)`. `LENGTH_COUNTS` is duplicated client+server — keep them in lockstep if either changes.
- Detail GET returns a required `status` (not_started|in_progress|passed) the frontend keys off.
- **The length picker must be reachable for `in_progress` tests, not just `not_started`.** Auto-resume (no picker) ONLY for `passed` (loads review). For `in_progress` the picker shows a "Continue where I left off" shortcut (resume same items) PLUS length buttons that restart fresh.
  **Why:** an earlier version auto-resumed `in_progress` and silently skipped the picker, so any already-started test never offered the length choice (user hit exactly this on the one in-progress test and thought the feature was missing).
- **Restarting at a new length = `retake:true`, which DELETES the existing in_progress attempt (items first, then row) and creates a fresh one.** Plain (non-retake) start still resumes in_progress. Because a restart can momentarily leave >1 in_progress under a race, the submit handler targets the NEWEST attempt (order DESC), never the oldest, so grading matches the item IDs actually shown.

- **Length options must be DISCOVERABLE on the diagnostics LIST page (`/reasoning`), not only inside the runner.** Each format row on the chooser renders three length buttons that deep-link to `/reasoning/:id?length=<len>`; the runner reads the param (wouter `useSearch`), auto-starts once (useRef guard, reset per `:id`), then strips the query via `setLocation(path,{replace:true})` so refresh resumes instead of restarting.
  **Why:** when length was only pickable after clicking into a test, the user repeatedly (3×) reported the feature as missing — a pure discoverability failure, not a logic bug. Surface the choice where the student first lands.
