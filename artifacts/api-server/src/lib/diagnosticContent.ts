// Two instruments, each administered at a baseline (before the course) and a
// checkpoint (after the single unit), with MUTUALLY UNIQUE items:
//   - Professional Judgment: realistic everyday-judgment scenarios where
//     legitimate considerations conflict. The principled choice is keyed first.
//   - Critical Reasoning (CCTST-style): items spanning analysis, inference,
//     evaluation, deduction, and induction.
//
// Each (instrument, phase) is offered in THREE selectable answer formats that
// share the same questions:
//   - mcq     — pick the single best option.
//   - hybrid  — pick the best option AND write a short justification.
//   - written — no options shown; write a short answer in your own words.
//
// All items are ORIGINAL. For every item the correct option is written FIRST;
// at seed time options are rotated so the correct answer lands at a varied
// index (see seedDiagnostics.ts). `modelAnswer` is the ideal short written
// response used to grade the written/hybrid formats.
